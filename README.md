# NODE_JS_INTERVIEW_PREPARATION

#### Create a Simple HTTP Server:
##### Write a Node.js program that creates a basic HTTP server and listens on port 3000. When a user visits the root URL (/), display a "Hello, World!" message in their browser.
#### Reading and Writing Files:

##### Write a Node.js program that reads data from a text file named "input.txt" and writes it to an output file named "output.txt."
#### Asynchronous Callbacks:
##### Implement a function that reads a list of file paths asynchronously and prints the contents of each file in the order they were passed as arguments. Use callback functions to handle asynchronous operations.
